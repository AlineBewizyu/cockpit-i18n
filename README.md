# Cockpit i18n / Backend translation files

Language files for Cockpit's backend


## Usage

Just copy the language files you need to `/config/cockpit/i18n`. After that you will be able to change the language of Cockpit users in the user management.

When the folder `/config/cockpit/i18n` is missing, just create it. Keep in mind to keep webserver permissions for those folders.
